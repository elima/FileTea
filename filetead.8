.SH NAME
filetead \- Web based file sharing service daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filetead
.I [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B filetead
command.
.PP
.B FileTea
is a Web service that provides instant and anonymous file-sharing using
only a standard browser as client. Unlike traditional Web based
file-sharing services, FileTea does not store files server-side. Instead,
files are just routed on-the-fly from seeder to leecher, through the server.

filetead is the service daemon that runs on a FileTea server. It handles peer
synchronization, file routing and status reporting.
